# Graph Powered Machine Learning Course 
## Exercise 1 
1.  Answers to all the three questions are available in the [RDFNotebook](https://github.com/Kashif-Rabbani/GPML-Exercises/blob/master/Exercise%201/1-RDFLib%20and%20Graphs.ipynb)
2.  Solution to PageRank question is available in the [PageRankNotebook](https://github.com/Kashif-Rabbani/GPML-Exercises/blob/master/Exercise%201/2-Pagerank.ipynb)

## Exercise 2 


### Part 1: A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks

Read sections 1,2,3,6 of the [A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00596v1.pdf) and discuss the following questions (roughly 1-2 paragraphs each):
1. **How are network embeddings and GCNs related?**
    
2. **What are the potential outputs of GCNs? Please describe one use-case for each potential output.**

3. **What are value is added by Graph Attention Networks over GCNs? What are potential disadvantage?**


4. **Why are GCNs relevant for Computer Vision?**




### Part 2: Graph Learning Tasks

Pick one of the following Graph Learning Tasks from the DGL Guide and create a python tutorial (preferably as jupyter notebook) for that example. Feel free to choose another dataset [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com) is a good starting point.
1. Node Classification/Regression 
2. Edge Classification/Regression 
3. Link Prediction
4. Graph Classification


Solution to this task is available in the [Node classification with SAGE- Notebook](https://github.com/Kashif-Rabbani/GPML-Exercises/blob/master/Exercise%202/Node_classification_with_SAGE.ipynb)
